When you struggle to chose your preferred profile picture, I struggle more because all I see is your beautiful angle. One may say that I am biased but how can I realize otherwise, I am just enamored by every detail and wholeness of you, even those I normally complain about. 
<br>
<br>
Even on your birthday, I am never immuned from saying the wrong things or acting the wrong way. I need to live with the fact that everything I hope to say will be misunderstood, every emotions I feel will not transcend easily. It is the human in me and all I can do is try. God will suffice the rest. I pray for God to guide me to you. 

<br>
<br>

Today, many would greet you and I do not dare to compete with anyones effort. It is important that you know that you are loved by many. However, rest assure that I will continue to try to show my love for you in obvious and non-obvious manners. I just pray that God will fill in between the lines and assure you that I had been praying for this moment since I was young: to be someone's and have someone. You had been a great choice and a blessing. Today marks that special occassion when even I was destined to be happy. Happy Birthday.

<br>
I LOVE YOU AND I HOPE YOU GET TO ENJOY YOUR DAY!
