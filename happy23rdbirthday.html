When you struggle to chose your preferred profile picture, I struggle more because all I see is your beautiful angle. One may say that I am biased but how can I realize otherwise, I am just enamored by every detail and wholeness of you, even those I normally complain about. 
<br>
<br>
Even on your birthday, I am never immuned from saying the wrong things or acting the wrong way. I need to live with the fact that everything I hope to say will be misunderstood, every emotions I feel will not transcend easily. It is the human in me and all I can do is try. God will suffice the rest. I pray for God to guide me to you. 

<br>
<br>

I LOVE YOU AND I HOPE YOU GET TO ENJOY YOUR DAY!
